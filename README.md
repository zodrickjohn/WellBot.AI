## Introduction

WellBot.AI is an intelligent web application designed to diagnose health issues based on user descriptions of pain and other symptoms. With advanced AI models and a 3D human body integration, users can interact with specific areas of the body to pinpoint their symptoms and get tailored suggestions for possible health concerns.

## Features

* 3D Human Body Integration: Users can select specific points on a 3D human body model where they feel pain. This interactive feature allows for precise symptom descriptions.
* Pain Type: Users can describe the type of pain (sharp, dull, throbbing, etc.) they are experiencing.
* Pain Duration: Specify how long the pain has been occurring (e.g., minutes, hours, days).
* Pain Severity: Users can rate the severity of the pain on a scale (e.g., mild, moderate, severe).
* Age and Gender: These factors help in providing personalized diagnostic suggestions.
* Additional Symptoms: Users can list any other symptoms they are experiencing alongside the pain.
* Extra Details: Users can provide any additional information relevant to the diagnosis.
* Medication History: Optionally, users can include details about any medications they are currently taking or have taken in the past.
